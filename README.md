# EduAll
Prototype Android App made for OneHack Hackathon


Theme of the Hackathon was to make a software prototype related to UN's Sustainable Development Goals(SDG).

EduAll is only a prototype, and doesn't fully support or implement the features discussed in the idea.


## IDEA
EduAll focuses on starting a campaign and increasing awareness and giving the chance for the less opportune kids to study.

Whenever someone sees some kids who do not have a chance to go to school or get proper education, they can use the app.
Upon opening EduAll, the app takes in the user's location and finds the locality. In the locality, if a Campaign already exists, the user can join the campaign and add the details of the students.
If not, they can start a new Campaign.


A Campaign lasts for 2-3 weeks, unless ended prematurely.
Once a Campaign is finished, the set of details of children can be sorted and sent to the nearest NGO and nearest Government schools.
Who can then help educate the children.
